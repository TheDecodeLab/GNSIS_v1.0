# AFib Prediction with GNSIS Data

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for predicting Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) using GNSIS data. AFib is a common cardiac arrhythmia that can lead to serious health complications. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using GNSIS data to identify individuals at risk of AFib.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:


2. Install the required dependencies:


3. Set up your environment and data paths.

## Data

The GNSIS data used in this project includes various features related to cardiovascular health, demographics, and medical history. The dataset is available at [link to dataset](https://www.example.com/dataset).

## Preprocessing

Before building the predictive model, data preprocessing is performed. This involves handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

## Model Development

The predictive model is developed using machine learning techniques. We experiment with various algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks to find the best performing model.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation is used to ensure the generalization of the model.

## Usage

To use the trained model for AFib prediction, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the pre-trained model:
```python
from afib_prediction_model import AFibPredictionModel

model = AFibPredictionModel.load_model('path/to/saved/model')
```

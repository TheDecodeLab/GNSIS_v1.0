# Goal
The long-term risk of recurrent ischemic stroke, estimated to be between 17%-30%, cannot be reliably assessed. Our goal is to study whether machine-learning models can be trained to predict stroke recurrence and identify key clinical variables and whether performance metrics can be optimized.

# Goal
Although some risk factors for stroke readmission have been reported, the mortality risk is unclear. We sought to evaluate etiologies and predictors of 30-day readmissions and determine the associated mortality risk.<br>
This was a retrospective caseâ€“control study to identify risk factors predicting 30-day readmission after stroke. A descriptive sub-study of the subset of patients who were readmitted was also conducted as was a mortality analysis of index and readmissions. This study was carried out in accordance with the Hartford Hospital Institutional Revenue Board after the protocol was reviewed and approved.
